# reports/AGENTS.md — Research Output Rules

## No manual edits

Figures/tables in reports must be generated by code, not edited by hand.

## Required structure

- `figures/` : images with stable names
- `tables/`  : csv/tex tables
- `status/`  : daily summaries from automation
- `paper/`   : manuscript source
- `deck/`    : slides source

## Each output must be traceable

Every figure/table must map to:
- input data artifact(s)
- code that generated it
- a run manifest (timestamp, command, versions)
