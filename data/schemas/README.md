# `data/schemas/` — tracked schemas (legacy-friendly)

If you need a stable, cross-project home for schemas, prefer `contracts/schemas/` as the canonical location.

You may use `data/schemas/` for project-specific schema copies or generated schema artifacts that should be tracked.

Raw data snapshots live under `data/raw/` and are not committed.
