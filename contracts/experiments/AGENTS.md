# contracts/experiments/AGENTS.md — Experiment Discipline

Experiments are part of the contract surface for modeling projects.

## Rules

- Experiments must be reproducible from declared inputs + seeds + environment info.
- Record experiment run manifests (timestamp, command, versions, output hashes).
